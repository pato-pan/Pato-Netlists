# Pato-Netlists
personal privacy blocklists and whitelists, hopefully you'll find it useful. Made for Pi-Hole

The main lists will have all my settings, which you may not like. I created different lists for specific purposes that should make it easier to incorporate to a larger audience

Some of my whitelists are made assuming a strict network policy (so, .* regex blacklist). I personally never do this for every device, and never on a browser. I only encourage this on specific applications or devices while always excluding web browsing.
